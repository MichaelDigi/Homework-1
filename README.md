[+]Viewed the source code of the existing HTML web page

[+]Also looked at the webpage in my browser to see how the structure is layed out.

[+]After understanding the structure of the HTML page I went ahead and refactored the code by giving it the proper semantic HTML elements

[+]Added ALT atributes to the icons and images

[+]Then made sure that the heading atributes fell into the proper squential order.

[+]Made sure that I gave the webpage a proper and descriptive title based on the name of website in h1. 

[+]Made sure that all that the navigation bar functioned correctly and goes to the proper section on the webpage when clicked on.

[+]Commented on all CSS changes that were made



!Bonus ways I imporved the code!

	- Noticed that in the heading at the top left for some reason the color of 
	3 of the letters only were different then the rest of the text and by 
	the looks of it that was possibly a mistake. 

	- Made sure that in css I grouped certain duplicate calsses such as the 
	search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, social-media-marketing
	because they had the same attributes so I cleaned the code by grouping them all 
	into one class.
